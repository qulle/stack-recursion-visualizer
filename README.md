# Author notes
I wrote this program during my first year at the University back in 2017.

## Compiling
I compiled using GNATMAKE 7.5.0
```
$ gnatmake ./stack_recursion.adb
```

## Runtime
Execute the program and it will ask for input to solve
```
$ ./stack_recursion 
```

## Tested
The code have been tested on:
- Linux machine running Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS with GNAT 7.5.0 
- Windows 10 machine running WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS with GNAT 7.5.0
